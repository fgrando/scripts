# scripts

This repo contains some ideas and  quick'n dirty scripts for my personal projects.  
Please feel free to contribute and ask questions.

I will try to keep this file updated with all functionalities available.

As this scripts grow, they will be moved to a specific repository, so if you feel like something is missing, look into my other repositories.
